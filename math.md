I am interested in different areas of mathematics: algebraic geometry, algebra,
number theory. My PhD research was on [*p*-adic Hodge
theory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_Hodge_theory)

- [Towards the cohomological construction of Breuil-Kisin
  modules](/static/thesis.pdf) --- my PhD thesis

- [A course in crystalline cohomology](/static/crystalline_cohomology.pdf) ---
  notes from a course given in 2013 at the University of Cambridge.  The main
  objective was to prove that a strongly divisible module over an unramified
  base was admissible in the sense of Fontaine by *de Rham* methods.
